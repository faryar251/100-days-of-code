# The Start.

I am going use this challenge to improve my Python programming skills. Also, I'll be focusing more on Data Structures and Algorithms using Python and posting the code and a bit of explanation every day on [my Medium](https://medium.com/@faryalm). My main goal is stay consistent and improve my programming skills. Thanks a lot. Happy Learning!
